## 🧠 Model Architecture

### Base Model
- **Model**: Llama-3.1-8B via Unsloth
- **Quantization**: 4-bit for memory efficiency
- **Max Context Length**: 2048 tokens

### LoRA Configuration (Best)
```python
{
    "r": 32,                  # Low-rank dimension
    "lora_alpha": 64,         # Scaling factor (2×r)
    "lora_dropout": 0.05,     # Regularization
    "target_modules": [
        "q_proj", "k_proj", "v_proj", "o_proj",
        "gate_proj", "up_proj", "down_proj"
    ],
    "trainable_params": "83.9M (1.03%)"
}
```

### Prompt Engineering
```
<<SYS>>
You are a precise math answer verifier.
Given a problem, a student's answer, and a reference solution,
respond with a single digit:
- 1 if the student's answer is correct
- 0 if the student's answer is incorrect
<</SYS>>

<<USR>>
Problem: {question}
Student Answer: {answer}
Solution (reference): {solution}
Return only the digit (1 or 0).
<</USR>>

<<ASSISTANT>>
{label}
```

### Constrained Decoding
- Forces model to output only "0" or "1" tokens
- Prevents hallucinations and parsing errors
- Implemented via custom `AllowedTokensLogitsProcessor`

## 📈 Lessons Learned

### Model Capacity Matters
Increasing LoRA rank from 16 to 32 significantly improved performance despite only adding 42M parameters.

### Data Efficiency
Using 99.5% of data for training (vs 90%) provided +1.4% accuracy improvement, demonstrating the value of maximizing training data when validation isn't used during training.

### Training Duration
2 epochs proved optimal - model continued learning without overfitting, suggesting mathematical reasoning benefits from extended training.

### Prompt Engineering
Explicit inclusion of reference solution in prompt context helped model better distinguish correct from incorrect answers.

## 🎯 Future Work

- **Scaling to full dataset**: Train on complete 1M samples (currently 5%)
- **Ensemble methods**: Combine multiple model checkpoints
- **Curriculum learning**: Start with simple problems, progress to complex
- **Larger LoRA ranks**: Experiment with rank 64, 128
- **Different base models**: Try Llama-3-70B or Mixtral variants
